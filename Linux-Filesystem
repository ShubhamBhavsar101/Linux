### ðŸ“‚ Linux Filesystem Hierarchy

A quick reference guide to key directories in a Linux system:

---

* **`/home`**
  Location for home directories for all users except the root user.
  Root user's home is `/root`.

* **`/opt`**
  Used to install third-party applications or software packages.

* **`/mnt`**
  Default mount point for partitions. Typically used for temporary mounting.

* **`/tmp`**
  Stores temporary data. Automatically cleaned periodically.

* **`/media`**
  Mount point for external media like USB drives, CDs, etc.

* **`/dev`**
  Contains special block and character device files representing hardware.

* **`/bin`**
  Basic system binaries like `cp`, `mv`, `mkdir`, etc.

* **`/etc`**
  Stores most system configuration files.

* **`/lib`** and **`/lib64`**
  Contain shared libraries required by programs in `/bin` and `/sbin`.

* **`/usr`**
  In modern systems, contains user-land applications and their data.
  (Note: Not used for user home directories anymore.)
